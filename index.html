         <p>I'm a junior at Bob Jones University studying biblical counseling with a focus on women's ministry. I work for IT as their Disposition specialist. Basically, I fix stuff, destroy stuff, keep records of it all, and rewrite instructions from IT lingo to things normal people can understand.</p>
         <p>
            I am very involved in my society currently. I will have been chaplain for both the spring and fall semesters of 2019. I am active in my local church: Palmetto Baptist Church in Easley, SC.  I run the Powerpoint during college group. I participate in our college small groups on campus every week. I am also involved with an outreach in Anderson, SC. I co-lead a bible study for teenage girls in the surrounding low-economic status neighborhoods.

         <p>
            I also love having deep talks with my friends about topics from theology to food.
