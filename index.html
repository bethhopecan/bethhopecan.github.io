         <p>I'm a junior at Bob Jones University studying biblical counseling with a focus on women's ministry. I work for IT as their Disposition specialist. Basically, I destroy fix stuff, destroy stuff, keep records of it all, and rewrite instructions from IT lingo to things normal people can understand.</p>
         <p>
            I am very involved in my society currently. I will have been chaplain for it for both the spring and fall semesters of 2019. I am active in my local church: Palmetto Baptist Church in Easley, SC.  I run the Powerpoint during college group. I also participate in our college small groups on campus from week to week. And I am also involved in an outreach in Anderson, SC of co-leading a bible study for teenage girls in the surrounding low-economic status neighborhood.

            I also love having deep talks with my friends about topics from theology to food.
